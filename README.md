> **Abstract** Editing hairstyle is unique and challenging due to the complexity and delicacy of hairstyle.
Although recent approaches significantly improved the hair details, this is achieved under the assumption that a target hair and a source image are aligned.
HairFIT, a pose-invariant hairstyle transfer model, alleviates this assumption, yet it still shows unsatisfactory quality in preserving delicate hair textures.
To solve these limitations, we propose a high-performing pose-invariant hairstyle transfer model equipped with a latent optimization and a newly presented local-style-matching loss.
In the StyleGAN2 latent space, we first explore a pose-aligned latent code of a target hair with the detailed textures preserved based on local-style-matching.
Then, our model inpaints the occlusions of the source considering the aligned target hair and blends both images to produce a final output.
The experimental results demonstrate that our model has strengths in transferring a hairstyle under higher pose differences and preserving local hairstyle textures.
